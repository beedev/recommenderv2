# Clean Slate Test - Fixed Commit Message Flow

This file demonstrates the corrected workflow:

## âœ… Fixed Issues:
1. **Database cleaned**: All previous records removed
2. **commit_message field**: Now empty until actual commit
3. **Proper workflow**: 
   - Log prompt/response â†’ commit_message = ""
   - During consolidation â†’ commit_message = enhanced message
   - After commit â†’ commit_included = true, commit_hash = actual_hash

## ðŸ”„ Current State:
- **exec_id**: 4f6a177d-5862-4bbc-8570-1cc81074505a  
- **commit_included**: false
- **commit_hash**: null
- **commit_message**: "" (empty as expected)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:
When this file is committed, the system will:
1. Consolidate uncommitted interactions
2. Set commit_message to the enhanced message
3. After successful commit, mark commit_included=true and set commit_hash
