# Enhanced Auto-Interception Test

This file demonstrates the enhanced auto-interception system that now captures:

## âœ… Comprehensive Development Sessions
- **File Changes**: All modifications, additions, deletions tracked
- **Git Activity**: Recent commits and repository state
- **Development Context**: Inferred work focus and session duration
- **Session Aggregation**: Complete development workflow context

## ðŸ”„ Current Capabilities
- Real-time file change detection using `git status --porcelain`
- Repository state analysis (branch, latest commit)
- Session duration and activity metrics
- Intelligent work categorization based on file types and paths

## ðŸ“Š Session Data Structure
```json
{
  "type": "comprehensive_session",
  "file_changes": [...],
  "git_activity": [...],
  "development_context": {
    "working_on": "inferred from changes",
    "session_duration": "seconds",
    "files_modified": "count",
    "change_types": ["modification", "addition", "deletion"]
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing
Creating this file should trigger the enhanced auto-interception system to capture this comprehensive development session within the next 10-second check interval.
